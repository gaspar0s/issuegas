                        The earth is suffering, human footprint has damaged our planet. Specially during the last century. It is OUR responsibility to take care of what surrounds us and what future generations will inherit as the place to live in.
                        <br>I’d like to highlight OUR, because yes, it is your duty as an individual living in this world. You may ask. ¿Aren’t huge international companies responsible for most of the pollution and damage to our planet? 
                        <br>
                        Of course they are, yet we need an ecological society that demands a change. And that starts with individuals. A society that does care about the environment can demand politicians to take actions against big business that take advantage of the planet.
                        <br> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And that is the leitmotif of this webpage. To awake you as a reader. You have to take actions immediately. The earth is dying and experts say that it may be irreversible. Therefore let’s support each other and clean up the mess that past and actual generations have created.
Here are some interest websites that have useful information regarding this issue:

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      You may have heard about recycling.<br>
                        The American society has left to the citizen’s choice whether to do it or not in many cases. We must do it and know the reason behind it.<br>
Recycling is one of the solutions that we can implement to improve our environment.
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into reusable objects to prevent pollution on land and in oceans.
                        <br>
                        <br>
Some Facts:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Over 24 trillion Styrofoam coffee cups are throw away each year.</li>
                            <li>The amount of wood and paper we throw away is enough to heat 50,000,000 homes for 20 years.</li>
                            <li>On average each one of us produces 4.4 pounds of solid waste each day.</li>
                            <li>If all our newspaper was recycled we could save 250,000,000 trees each year.</li>
                            <li>Plastic bags and garbage that are throw away into the ocean have devastating effects on sea animals.</li>
                            <li>24 trees are cut down to make 1 ton of paper.</li>
                            <li>In the US we use 2,500,000 plastic bottles every hour.</li>
                            <li>There is no limit to the amount of times a can made from aluminum can be recycled.</li>
                            <li>We generate 21,5 million tons of food waste each year.</li>
                    </ul>
This is definitely terrifying, so let’s breakdown how we can recycle. <br>
<ol>
    <li> Buy recycled paper and print on both sides. When using paper in the office, print on both sides of the sheet and recycle the paper when you are finished. By recycling one ton of paper, you can save 17 trees, almost 7,000 gallons of water and more than three cubic yards of landfill space.</li>
    <br> <li>Recycle your outdated technology. According to EPA, Americans throw out two million tons of e-waste each year. Avoid adding to that waste by recycling your old technology. For more information on electronic recycling, visit <br><a href="http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/recycle/ecycling/donate.htm." target="_blank">United States Enviromental Protection Agency.</a></li>
   <br> <li>Make recycling bins readily available. Make sure your home and office are outfitted with recycling bins for paper, plastic and metal. Keep them out in the open and label them appropriately. Sometimes the convenience factor is all that is needed.</li>
     <br><li>Recycle your empty ink and toner cartridges. Almost eight cartridges are thrown out in the United States every second of every day. That's almost 700,000 cartridges per day.</li>
    <br> <li>Buy remanufactured ink and toner cartridges. Each remanufactured cartridge keeps approximately 2.5 pounds of metal and plastic out of landfills and saves about a half gallon of oil.</li>
 <br><li>Recycle old newspapers laying around the office. When finished reading the newspaper, either leave it for someone else to read or recycle it.</li>
    <br> <li>Look for the recycled option in all the products you buy. It's not just paper that is recycled.</li>
                    <br> <li>Buy rechargeable batteries. It takes 1,000 regular batteries to equal the lifespan of one rechargeable battery. When you are discarding your batteries, recycle them.</li>
                    <br> <li>Purchase rewritable CDs and DVDs so that you can reuse them from project to project.</li>
                   <br> <li> Reuse your morning coffee cup. Or better yet, buy a mug to avoid the waste caused by throwing away the paper or Styrofoam.</li>
                    </ol>

                          <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-section-title mb-4">Emissions</h2>
                          <p class="mb-5">
                          America is one of the biggest and largest countries of the world. Therefore the territorial extension requires transportation. This translates into 290,800,000 vehicles only in U.S.A. There are 868 vehicles per 1000 people. Additionally, passenger vehicles account for roughly 16.4% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. It may seem little but there is room for fighting agains this problem. 
<br>
Buying and EV (Electric Vehicle) or a hybrid one is definitely one of the things we can do. Although we understand that it may not be the most suitable or affordable option. However, there is no need to buy 400HP cars that pollute way more than a usual utilitarian. Furthermore, pickups trucks or huge cars like SUV’s are heavier hence require more fuel and pollute more.
<br> 
We must aim for smaller cars with less HP besides looking at the emission. The average new car emits 120.1g/km of CO. European cars are between 95/110 g/km of CO. The lower, the better obviously. Consequently taking into account all these factors we may do some research the next time we need to buy a car. Because yes, we should buy cars when we need them not when we desire them. Last but not least, car sharing and public transportation is key. Were we to share ride whenever we need it we would chop down emissions significantly. It is an easy and social change that can do so much good to our planet that we should do it right away!.
